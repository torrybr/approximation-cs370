/////expox.c 
(1) uses fork()   to launch another process
(2) uses exec() command to replace the program driving this process, while also supplying 
the arguments that this new program (expoxch.c) needs to complete its execution.
(3) uses wait() command to wait for the completion of the execution of the child process.

expox.c will take two command line arguments and pass them on to the expoxch.c. 
The command line arguments for expox.c are x (a number less than 1) and n (number of terms to be added, 
1 or more).

/////expoxch.c

two arguments to obtain an approximation of  e^x by adding the first n terms, and prints the result using the format
>  Child(PID =xxx): For x =0.5 the first 5 terms yield 1.6484375
